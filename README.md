# Final Project

By Robin Kock and Jasper van Thuijl

This project uses ray marching as described here: https://github.com/ajweeks/RaymarchingWorkshop/blob/master/readme.md

Use the WASD keys to move, drag the mouse while holding the button to look around.
If the program runs too slow, please make the window smaller (or toggle the ENABLE_SHADOWS in the fragment shader)

We display a grid of fractals.
